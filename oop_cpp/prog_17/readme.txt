    Fullname, Enrolment_no, marks in five subjects.
    Create constructor to initialize the values (non-parameterised and parameterised).
    Create functions to getdata( ) to get the Learner details from the user,
    display() to display the results,
    total_marks( )to display total marks scored by a Learner, 
    max_marks ( ) and min_marks ( ) to display the maximum and minimum marks secured by the Learner. (10)
