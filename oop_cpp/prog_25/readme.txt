Create a class called “TIME” that has three integer data members for hours, minutes
and seconds. The class should have a constructor to initialize the object to zero and 
a constructor to initialize the object to some constant value. 
The class should have member function to add two TIME objects and member 
function to display time in HH:MM:SS format. Write a main function to create two TIME objects, 
add them and display the result in HH:MM:SS format
