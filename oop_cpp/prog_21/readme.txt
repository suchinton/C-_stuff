Design three classes: Student, Exam and Result. 
The student class has data members such as roll no, name etc. 
Create a class Exam by inheriting the Student class. 
The Exam class adds data members representing the marks scored in six subjects. 
Derive the Result from class Exam and it has its own members such as total marks. 
Write an interactive program to model this relationship.
